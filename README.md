# ASPNET_Project_Baespeaks.com
A website I created with ASP.NET Core using the content from my blog baespeaks.com

- Target Framework is NET 6
- One user login is daniel@baespeaks.com and the password is "asdfasdf"
- Password Reset and Email Confirmation links are sent to the log file called LogFile.txt which is in the root directory
- The Id property is set to 0 before passing the view model to the client when Id encryption is used for url parameters
- The following NuGet packages are used: bootstrap 5.1.2, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore 6.0.0, Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore 6.0.0, Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design 6.0.0, Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite 6.0.0, Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools 6.0.0
