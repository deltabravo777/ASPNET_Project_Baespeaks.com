# ASPNET_Project_Baespeaks.com
A website I created with ASP.NET Core using the content from my blog baespeaks.com

Target Framework is NET 6
One user login is daniel@baespeaks.com and the password is "asdfasdf"
Password Reset and Email Confirmation links are sent to the log file called LogFile.txt which is in the root directory
The Id property is set to 0 before passing the view model to the client when Id encryption is used for url parameters
The following NuGet packages are used: bootstrap, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore, Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore, Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design, Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite, Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
